# Hospital-Stay-Length-Prediction

Accurately predicting hospital length of stay is of significant importance for effective hospital resource planning and management. By having a better estimate of how long a patient will remain in the hospital, resources such as wards and hospital beds can be scheduled more efficiently, and elective surgeries can be planned based on the upcoming availability of beds.

The primary objective of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of different models and data-preprocessing techniques.
